## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 13, React 18, JavaScript (Standard.js style)
- **Editor**: Editor.js for rich text editing
- **Desktop**: Electron for cross-platform native apps (primary platform)
- **Mobile**: Progressive Web App (PWA)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, Radix UI components, Stylus modules
- **Security**: AES-256-GCM encryption, DOMPurify sanitization, Argon2-style password hashing
- **State**: Zustand for global state, React hooks for local state

## 🏗️ How It Works

### Data Storage

Dash stores all data locally on your device:

| Platform | Storage Method | Location |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| **Desktop (Electron)** | JSON files | User data directory (`~/Library/Application Support/Dash` on macOS) |
| **Mobile (PWA)** | IndexedDB | Browser storage (persists offline) |
| **Web Browser** | localStorage | For development/testing only |

### Security Model

1. **Content Sanitization**: All editor content is sanitized with DOMPurify before saving
2. **Password Protection**: Individual pages can be encrypted with AES-256-GCM
3. **No Network Requests**: Data never leaves your device
4. **Sandboxed Electron**: Desktop app runs in a secure sandbox

### Key Components

- **`usePagesManager`** - Central hook for all page operations (create, save, delete, lock/unlock)
- **`storage.js`** - Abstraction layer that auto-detects the environment
- **`Editor.js`** - Rich text editor with customizable block types
- **`electron-main.js`** - Desktop app main process (file I/O, updates)

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed technical documentation.

## 🧪 Testing

### Desktop App (Primary)

Most users run Dash as a desktop app. To test the desktop version:

```bash
# Development mode (with hot reload)
npm run electron-dev

# Build for production
npm run electron:build

# The built app will be in the dist/ folder
```

### Browser Testing

Browser testing is useful for UI development but has limitations:
- File system operations don't work (Electron-specific)
- Auto-updates don't work
- Data is stored in localStorage (less persistent)

```bash
# Run in browser mode
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

### What Works in Browser vs Desktop

| Feature | Browser | Desktop |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Rich text editing | ✅ | ✅ |
| Page/folder management | ✅ | ✅ |
| Theme switching | ✅ | ✅ |
| Password protection | ✅ | ✅ |
| Export to PDF/MD/etc | ✅ | ✅ |
| Persistent file storage | ❌ | ✅ |
| Auto-updates | ❌ | ✅ |
| Native menus | ❌ | ✅ |

## 🐛 Bug Reports

Found a bug? Please open an issue with:
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Your OS and Dash version
- Screenshots if applicable

### Known Issues & Troubleshooting

**"Electron not available" in console (Browser mode)**
- This is expected when running in browser mode. Use `npm run electron-dev` for desktop testing.

**Pages not saving (Browser mode)**
- Browser mode uses localStorage which has size limits. For production use, run the desktop app.

**Folder contents appear empty after restart**
- Fixed in recent versions. Ensure you're running the latest version.

**Add Page to Folder doesn't show newly created pages**
- Fixed in recent versions. Update to the latest version.
