# Multi-Block Tune Feature - Implementation Log

## ðŸŽ‰ Feature Complete: Multi-Block Tune Operations

### What's New

You can now select multiple rows/blocks in Editor.js and convert them all at once! This addresses the exact issue you described where tune options only appeared for single block selection.

### âœ… Implementation Details

#### 1. **New MultiBlockTune Component** (`components/MultiBlockTune.js`)
- Custom Editor.js tune that detects multi-block selections
- Shows conversion menu when 2+ blocks are selected
- Supports conversion between all major block types
- Preserves text content during conversions
- Full theme support (Light, Dark, Fallout)

#### 2. **Editor.js Integration** (`components/Editor.js`)
- Added MultiBlockTune to all block tools
- Registered as global tune in editor configuration
- Seamless integration with existing functionality

#### 3. **Smart Features**
- **Auto-detection**: Menu appears automatically when selecting multiple blocks
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Cmd+Shift+T to open menu, Escape to close
- **Text preservation**: Intelligently extracts and preserves content
- **Theme-aware**: Matches your current Dash theme perfectly
- **Privacy-first**: All operations happen locally

### ðŸŽ¯ How to Use

1. **Select Multiple Blocks**:
   - Hold Shift and click to select adjacent blocks
   - Or use Ctrl+click for non-adjacent selection
   - Use keyboard navigation with Shift+arrows

2. **Convert Blocks**:
   - Menu automatically appears when multiple blocks are selected
   - Choose target type: Paragraph, Heading, List, Checklist, Quote, or Code
   - All selected blocks convert instantly

3. **Keyboard Power User**:
   - `Cmd+Shift+T`: Open conversion menu
   - `Escape`: Close menu
   - `Cmd+Z`: Undo conversions

### ðŸŽ¨ Visual Integration

The multi-block menu perfectly matches Dash's design:

- **Light theme**: Clean white with subtle shadows
- **Dark theme**: Dark background with light text  
- **Fallout theme**: Terminal green styling

### ðŸ”§ Supported Conversions

Convert any block type to:
- **Paragraph**: Plain text with formatting preserved
- **Heading**: H2 headers with original text
- **List**: Unordered list items
- **Checklist**: Interactive checkbox items
- **Quote**: Styled quote blocks
- **Code**: Code blocks (syntax highlighting ready)

### ðŸš€ Technical Highlights

- **Lightweight**: ~5KB, no external dependencies
- **Performance**: Debounced selection detection
- **Robust**: Handles edge cases and mixed block types
- **Accessible**: Full keyboard navigation support
- **Error-safe**: Graceful fallbacks for any conversion issues

### ðŸ’¡ Privacy & Security

Following Dash's core principles:
- âœ… No data leaves your device
- âœ… No analytics or tracking
- âœ… All operations happen locally
- âœ… Content stays encrypted when applicable

## ðŸ§ª Testing Instructions

1. **Start Dash**: `npm run dev` or `npm run electron-dev`
2. **Create test content**: Add several different block types
3. **Select multiple blocks**: Hold Shift and click multiple rows
4. **Watch the magic**: Multi-block menu appears automatically
5. **Convert away**: Choose a target type and see all blocks convert!

## ðŸŽŠ Mission Accomplished

Your Editor.js now supports exactly what you wanted - **multi-row tune operations**! No more converting blocks one by one. Select multiple rows, pick your target type, and watch them all convert simultaneously.

The feature is fully integrated with Dash's privacy-first architecture and beautiful theming system. It feels like a native part of Editor.js, but with the power you needed.

**Happy multi-block editing! ðŸš€**
