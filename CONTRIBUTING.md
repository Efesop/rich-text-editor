# Contributing to Dash

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Dash! 🎉

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Clone** your fork: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/rich-text-editor.git`
3. **Install** dependencies: `npm install`
4. **Start** development: `npm run electron-dev`

## 🛠️ Development

### Running the App

```bash
# Web development server (for UI development)
npm run dev

# Desktop app in development (recommended for testing)
npm run electron-dev

# Build desktop app for production
npm run electron:build

# Build PWA for mobile
npm run build:pwa
```

### Testing Your Changes

**For most changes**, test in the desktop app (`npm run electron-dev`) since that's how users run Dash.

Browser mode (`npm run dev`) is useful for:
- Rapid UI iteration
- React component development
- Styling and theme work

Browser mode **won't work** for:
- File system operations
- Auto-update features
- Testing persistence across sessions

### Code Style

- **Standard.js**: No semicolons, 2-space indentation
- **Functional components**: Always use hooks, never class components
- **Descriptive naming**: `isLoading`, `hasError`, `handleSubmit`
- **File organization**: Component → Subcomponents → Helpers → Static content
- **Theme support**: Always handle light, dark, and fallout themes
