# Dash Mobile Setup - Privacy-First Approach

## How This Maintains Your Privacy

The PWA approach for mobile **still maintains complete privacy**:

1. **No Backend Server** - GitHub Pages only serves static files
2. **No Analytics** - Zero tracking, no data collection
3. **No User Accounts** - Everything stays on device
4. **Offline After Install** - One-time download, then fully offline
5. **No Network Requests** - Service worker caches everything

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository settings on GitHub
2. Navigate to "Pages" in the sidebar
3. Under "Build and deployment":
   - Source: "GitHub Actions"
4. Save the settings

### 2. Deploy the PWA

The workflow will automatically deploy when you push to main:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Setup PWA for mobile"
git push origin main
```

### 3. Access Your PWA

After deployment (takes ~5 minutes), your PWA will be available at:
```
https://efesop.github.io/rich-text-editor
```

### 4. Install on iOS

Users can install by:
1. Visiting the URL in Safari
2. Tapping the Share button
3. Selecting "Add to Home Screen"
4. The app works fully offline after installation

## Privacy Guarantees

- **GitHub Pages**: No server-side code, no data collection
- **Static Files Only**: Just HTML, CSS, JS - no backend
- **Service Worker**: Caches everything for offline use
- **No External Requests**: No CDNs, no analytics, no fonts
- **Data Stays Local**: All notes remain on the device

## Testing Locally

To test the PWA build locally:

```bash
npm run build:pwa
npx serve out -p 3000
```

Then visit http://localhost:3000/rich-text-editor

## Manual Installation Option

For maximum privacy, users can also:
1. Download the built files from GitHub
2. Host them on their own device/server
3. Access via local network only

## Why This Is Secure

1. **No Cloud Sync** - Data never leaves the device
2. **Encrypted Exports** - Manual transfer via .dashpack files
3. **No Tracking** - No cookies, no analytics, no telemetry
4. **Open Source** - Users can verify the code themselves
5. **Self-Hostable** - Users can run their own instance

## Alternative: TestFlight (100 users)

If you prefer not to use any web hosting at all:
1. Build with Capacitor: `npx cap build ios`
2. Upload to TestFlight (requires $99/year Apple Developer account)
3. Share TestFlight link with up to 100 users
4. No App Store review required
